Hello world. 


![](/images/earthillustrate.jpg)
     
     
I hope to use this space as a way to communicate thoughts, but mostly as a way to get more familiar with the world of Github. Eventually, I aim to use it as a home for hosting my `R code` as that becomes more necessary in my career. I am a currently **4th year** PhD student @ NCSU University and work at Hogan Assessments as a *Data Science Intern.* In my free time, you can find me:
1. At an F45 fitness class
2. Enjoying an outdoor walk, or 
3. Creating things (mostly recipes at the moment). 👩‍🍳

I am available via email: sdstegem@ncsu.edu.

Bye for now :wave:
