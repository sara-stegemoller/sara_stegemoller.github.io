## This is my first blog post.

**What do you think being a data scientist is about?** 

Being a data scientists involves taking complex and large sets of data and making them more accessible and understanble. This includes things such as *data exploration, building models to answers questions, provide solutions, and making predictions.

**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**  
Data scienctists are knowledgeable in statistics, math, one or more programming languages, as well as being a subject matter expert in some field. Data scientists are responsible for taking large amounts of data and "simplifying" their components in a way that allows stakeholders and persons of interests to better digest their informaiton. Many times, this also includes critical thinking on the part of the data scientist in order to figure out the best (or most appropriate) means to manipulate, configure, and analyze the data.

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**  
Data scientists have more of a critical thinking and creative approach to solving problems and answering questions using data, whereas statisticians seem to adhere more to the status quo. Truthfully, there are likely more similarities than differences, such as knowledge of statistics, math, programming, and basic comfortability with data.

**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**

In one of the articles we were provided, the author writes *"Eventually, as more statisticians pick up on skills like implementing algorithms that learn from data, and provide predictions and actions and more data scientists pick up on statistical science (sampling, experimental design, confidence intervals, p-values, etc.) the boundary between data scientists and statisticians will eventually blur."*
I would argue that any good data scientist must be versed in sampling, experimental design, confidence intervals, and p-values. So, to this end, I would say I am more of a statistician. However, in taking the defintion I provided above, I am much more closely aligned with a data scienctist, given that my main goal when working with data is usually to provide insights and digging deeper into the story the data is telling.
